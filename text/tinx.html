<p><strong>Q: What is TinX?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> <strong>TinX stands for TinX is not XSLT</strong> 
          in the sense that GNU 's not Unix. I was inspired by XML like structures 
          being processed over the wire using tools that flattened out structures 
          and inflated them back. In 1997 I was introducted to an XML like structure 
          used to transfer banking information from customer to business processing 
          center and back. The tools that existed then were not mature. We built 
          specialized tools, but there were limited generic tools for processing 
          these documents. Enter TinX.</p>
        <p>TinX is a transformation engine for XML Documents from <a href="http://www.lse.com">Lucas 
          Software Engineering, Inc</a>.. The current release focuses on mapping 
          XML to XML and has the ability to map to Java class and object methods 
          in order to call logic compiled inside of Java classes. It also includes 
          support for calling JavaScript functions and SQL.</p>
        <p>The idea behind TinX is that XSLT is great for web pages and various 
          other translations, and document generation from templates, but is it 
          right for everything? What about server side dynamic content with XML? 
          Perhaps the need for TinX is best summed up with: &quot;If the only 
          tool you have is a hammer, everything begins to look like a nail&quot;.</p>
        <p>TinX's basic product is designed around XML document processing. This 
          design allows for stream based processing using very fast SAX event 
          handlers. The TinX map is geared toward developers with easy tasks to 
          move the equivalent of XML tree structures values into the appropriate 
          Java calls and/or XML responses.</p>
        <p>Eventually TinX will be capable of String, Delimited Text, and XML 
          input and output options as well as SQL calls directly mapped to an 
          XML Document Request and Response.messages.<br>

    <tr> 
      <td><p><strong>Q: Why another transformation tool?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> As mentioned in What is TinX?, you may be satisfied 
          with using your own in-house tools, various open source projects, or 
          XSLT to solve your problems, but TinX is focused on XML document processing. 
          The goal for TinX was to make enterprise integration easier for developers 
          using XML documents to pass multiple requests like in the OFX and IFX 
          standards.<br>
          <br>
          This will also help in multiple channel integration and the enterprise 
          view of the customer. TinX is about Business To Business (B2B) processing. 
          And a close eye is given to the &quot;batch&quot; processing current 
          institutions use in combining multiple system of record information. 
          Eventually there will be more tools that come out that build upon the 
          engine's language like syntax and help speed business document processing 
          to production.<br>

      <td><p><strong>Q: Why did you decide to use XSD Schema instead of DTD?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> DTDs are an earlier description of how an XML file 
          may be defined. It lacks some of the more descriptive attributes about 
          elements and entities and can help in establishing data formats. The 
          industry is already moving in that direction and it makes sense to support 
          it first. The current syntax of TinX can be found in the <a href="http://www.lse.com/tinx/1.0/xml/tinx.xsd">tinx.xsd</a> 
          file.<br>

        <p><strong>Q: What is the product structure to TinX? Is it free?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A: </strong>TinX is a commercial product and comes in three 
          flavors: Personal, Standard, and Enterprise. The cost varies based on 
          the edition and volume. These licenses are Node-Locked to a particular 
          machine. </p>
        <p>The <strong>Personal Edition</strong> will only allow one thread to 
          handle all the transformations. This will be slower than the Standard 
          Edition, but will give developers an opportunity to try TinX out. The 
          Personal will require annual registration. Special Academic Licenses 
          are available of this version.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> will be Node-Locked and allow 
          multiple users to use the engine. This will be limited to 4 concurrent 
          threads. This will be for the small shops and low number of system users 
          in a XML document processing environment. </p>
        <p>The <strong>Enterprise Edition</strong> is for the large business, 
          corporation, or government agency that has systems configured with multiple 
          CPUs and hundreds to thousands of users. This edition allows for the 
          configuration of threads based on the performance characteristics of 
          the client. This is a Node-Locked license but can be purchased in sub-net 
          configuration (Class C restriction). In the sub-net license, the product's 
          license will enable the TinX engine to run up to 253 instances of TinX 
          on the same sub-net. This is what we term Sub-Net Locked.</p>
        <p>Annual Support is available. For price and support terms, please contact

      <td><p><strong>Q: What are the systems requirements?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> TinX is a 100% Java Solution that depends on J2SE. 
          It does require the Security API as well as support for JDBC and JAXP. 
          It has currently been tested with Sun JDK 1.4.1. It should work with 
          Sun JDK 1.4.2 and up on platforms supporting that JVM. It has also worked 
          with IBM JDK 1.4.0 and JRockit 8.1. Currently tested platforms include: 
          Linux and Windows.</p>
        <p>TinX is dependant on <a href="http://www.dom4j.org">DOM4J (http://www.dom4j.org)</a> 
          and <a href="http://jaxen.sourceforge.net">Jaxen (http://jaxen.sourceforge.net)</a>. 
          There is built in support for JavaScript <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino">(Rhino 
          http://www.mozilla.org/rhino)</a> as a scripting language. TinX requires 
          a XML SAX Parser and has been tested with <a href="http://piccolo.sourceforge.net">Piccolo 
          SAX Parser (http://piccolo.sourceforge.net)</a> (some bugs, see Piccolo 
          web site on attribute truncation), <a href="http://xml.apache.org/crimson">Crimson 
          (http://xml.apache.org/crimson)</a>, and <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j">Xerces 
          2 (http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j)</a>.<br>
          <br>
          DOM4J, Jaxen, Crimson and JavaScript (Rhino from Mozilla.org) binaries 
          have been bundled with the TinX jar file for simplicity.<br>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> Current download instructions can be found <a href="http://www.lse.com/tinx/release/1.0/install.html">here</a>. 
          There are three separate ways to install. Windows .exe, Unix .bin, and 
          Generic Jar install files. Pick the one that is right for you. Enjoy!
